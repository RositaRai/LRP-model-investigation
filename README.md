# LRP-model-investigation
This repository contains the program code from a study investigating the impact of Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) model parameters, specifically focusing on the epsilon (ε) and gamma (γ) settings. This work forms an integral part of a Bachelor's thesis, which aims to elucidate classification results using LRP techniques.
